Program s that generate negative credit subsidy result in offsetting receipts for the federal government, while programs that generate positive credit subsidy require an appropriation to cover the cost of new loan guarantees.51 The MMI Fund has historically been estimated to generate a negative credit subsidy in the year that the loans are insured and therefor e has not required appropriations to cover the expected costs of loans to be insured . The MMI Fund does receive appropriations to cover salaries and administrative contract expenses. The amount of money that loans insured in a given year actually earn for or cost the government over the course of their lifetime is likely to be different from the original credit subsidy estimates. Therefore, e ach year as part of the annual budget process , each prior year s credit subsidy rates are re -estimated based on the actual performance of the loans and other factors, such as updated economic projections. These re -estimates affect the way in which funds are held in the MMI Fund s two primary accounts: the Financing Account and the Capital Reserve Account.

Down payment The down payment is not truly an accounting cost, since youll get it all back when you sell (so long as home prices dont fall), but you still need to save up for it to get the loan.

As housing competition slows down, it might not be as important to have a big down payment as a means to outbid others; todays potential buyer may still need to delay homeownership to save enough to make",

For a time, FHA had an administrative policy of automatically cancelling the annual mortgage insurance premium when, based on the initial amortization schedule, the loan bal ance reached 78% of the initial property value.40 This policy applied for loans that were originated between the beginning of 2001 through mid -2013.

Cancelling premiums based on the initial property value meant that premiums could be cancelled even if house price declines had left borrowers with little current equity i n their homes.42 Options for FHA -Insured Loans in Default An FHA -insured mortgage is considered delinquent any time a payment is due and not paid. Once the borrower is 30 days late in making a payment, the mortgage is considered to be in default. In general, mortgage servicers may initiate foreclosure on an FHA -insured loan when three monthly installments are due and unpaid, and they must initiate foreclosure when six monthly installments are due and unpaid, except when prohibited by law.43 Prior to i nitiating foreclosure, mortgage servicers are to attempt to make contact with borrowers and evaluate whether they qualify for certain foreclosure avoidance options, known as loss mitigation.44 The options are to be considered in a specific order , and specif ic eligibility criteria apply to each option .

    "answer": "the lenders gross fees for writing your loan. An online lender is going to offer less hand-holding. Mortgage Brokers What they are: Mortgage brokers are essentially personal home loan shoppers - they act as liaisons between home buyers and mortgage lenders to help people find the lowest rates and the best mortgage terms. Theyre able to get home buyers the best mortgage rates because they leverage their existing relationships with lenders - something individual home buyers cant do. By doing the heavy lifting for the borrower, the idea is that they make loan shopping more convenient - and perhaps a bit faster. Who youll work with: A mortgage broker can be an individual agent or a group of agents, who act as independent contractors. In exchange for their services, mortgage brokers typically charge a 1% to 2% fee of the loan amount, which is either paid by the borrower or the lender at closing. Now that youre armed with the basics, youll want to give yourself time to weigh the options about which lender, exactly, to work with. Over the life of the loan, seemingly subtle differences could add up to tens of thousands of dollars.

    "question": "How does the document describe ownership?",
    "answer": "y This section contains a group of frequently used terms related to the purchase and financing of real estate assets. 1031 Exchange or Like-kind Exchange U.S. Internal Revenue Code Section 1031 permits the deferral of capital gains taxes on the sale of property held for investment or productive use in a trade or a business in a like-kind exchange. With a 1031 exchange, property owners can sell their real estate and then reinvest the proceeds in ownership of a like-kind property or up to three like-kind properties, thus deferring the capital gains taxes. The owner must identify the property(ies) within 45 days and close within 180 days. 1031 exchanges are legal transactions and require a 1031 intermediary. The like-kind exchange under Section 1031 is tax-deferred, not tax-free. When the replacement property is ultimately sold (not as part of another exchange), the original deferred gain, plus any additional gain realized since the purchase of the replacement property, is subject to tax. Basis Points (bps) Values equal to one-hundredth of one percentage point. For example, 100 basis points = 1 percentage point. Capital Expenses or Cap Ex Improvements (as opposed to repairs) to a fixed asset that will increase the value or useful life of that asset. A capital expenditure is typically amortized or depreciated over the useful life of the asset, as opposed to a repair, which is expensed in the year incurred.",

    "question": "How does the document describe purchase?",
    "answer": "ency In rare circumstances, one agent may represent both the buyer and the seller in a transaction. This is called dual agency. For example, lets say you dont have a real estate agent yet and see a listing that you love. If you reach out to the listing agent directly and they help guide you through the sale, this is dual agency. Dual agency presents obvious conflicts of interest, and its illegal in several states. States that allow it have laws that dictate when dual agency must be disclosed, if the agent must explain what dual agency means, and whether the buyer and seller must provide written or verbal agreement. If your agent discloses dual agency, you have the right to decide if you want to proceed with the transaction with your agent or another agent - or walk away from the purchase entirely. WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF HIRING A REAL ESTATE AGENT? Working with a real estate agent means you have an experienced industry professional on your side, likely at no cost to you. Beyond the fact that, in most cases, they wont cost you anything, working with a real estate agent offers you numerous other benefits, including: Expertise and knowledge: Real estate agents have extensive knowledge of the local housing market and can guide you through the buying process, from searching for properties to making an offer. They may also have useful information about the areas schools, neighborhoods, attractions, and other factors that could influence your home search.",

    "answer": "why its a good idea to get a professional inspection of your home - even before you make the offer. HUD strongly urges every home buyer to get a professional inspection, whether youre buying a HUD Home or not. HUD Homes are sold in as-is condition. That means you agree, if you buy the home, to accept it in its present condition. HUD does not pay for the correction of defects in existing homes that it sells or on homes purchased with FHA-insured mortgages. The owner of the home will be responsible for needed repairs. Therefore, be sure of the condition of the home before you submit your offer. THE FINISH LINE. The day you finally close on your new home will probably be one of the most exciting in your life. Finally, the long, tedious process of finding a home and getting a loan is over, and by the time the day is done, youll be the proud and happy owner of your new home. Before that day ends, you will be asked to sign a seemingly endless number of forms, but the closing agent will go over each one with you. Its all necessary, but you can make it a little easier by asking the real estate agent about it before the big day comes. Also, when you apply for your loan, your lender is required to give you a booklet explaining closing costs, an estimate of how much cash youll have to supply at the closing, and a list of all the documents youll need.",

The statute allows for special higher limits for Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and the Virgin Islands (see 12 U.S.C. 1715d). To look up the maximum mortgage amount for a specific area, see HUDs website at  idapp/ html/ hicostlook.cfm . 24 FHA calculates area -by-area limits each year based on the prior years area median home price data, so the actual dollar amount of the limit in a given area can change from year to year. The maximum mortgage amounts are set on a county basis, except tha t in metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) the maximum mortgage amount for the entire MSA is based on the county within the MSA that has the highest median home price. 25 In early 2008, Congress enacted the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 (ESA, P.L. 110 -185), which temporarily increased the maximum mortgage amounts for a one -unit home to 125% of area median home prices, with a floor of $271,050 and a high -cost area ceiling of $ 729,750.

If the loan term is 25 months or less, the Lender will receive one billing statement that reflects the entire insurance charge. For all other loan terms, the initial billing statement will reflect the annual premium for the year, plus any applicable penalt y or interest for late premium payments. HUD bills a Lender for the remaining premium installments annually. This billing occurs during the month of the loan disbursement anniversary. The final annual installment may be adjusted to reconcile with the total insurance charge due. A premium is not required and HUD will not bill for a period of 14 Days or less after acknowledgement of the loan report in FHAC. A charge for a full month is assessed for a period of more than 14 Days.

Lower discount rates equate to lower levels of risk and lower expected return. Entry Cap Rate The entry cap rate represents the going-in or entry rate when acquiring a building. It is typically the projected first years net operating income divided by the acquisition price. Exit Cap Rate The exit cap rate, sometimes called terminal or reversion cap rate, is the expected capitalization rate at sale. For example, in a five-year discounted cash flow projection, the expected sale price would be the sixth years project cash flow divided by the exit cap rate. Best practice for cash flow projections would have the exit cap rate at a higher yield (lower price) than the entry cap rate. Internal Rate of Return (IRR) The annualized yield, or rate of return, on capital investment produced from an income-producing investment. Formally, IRR is the discount rate such that the discounted sum of the future cash flows (net present value) equals the initial capital investment.

New Appliances/Furniture: New homes dont often come fully furnished and may not have all the appliances you need. Old appliances may also need to be replaced or updated. Costs will vary depending on your needs and preferences, but a few common needs are: + Washer/dryer set: $500-$2,000 + Countertop microwave: $65-$150 + Living room set: $1,000 and up + Bedroom set: $2,000 and up + Patio furniture: $200 and up Security Systems/Cameras: Its wise to protect your investment. The average cost to install a home security system ranges from $200 to $600, plus an additional monthly subscription fee for monitoring services. Purchasing equipment you can install yourself may help cut costs. Pest Control: Quarterly preventive pest control treatments range from $100 to $300, on average. Treatment for a bug infestation can climb into the thousands, such as if you need termite fumigation. HOA Dues: If your home is part of a homeowners association (HOA), youll likely be required to pay HOA fees and dues.

A down payment is the out-of-pocket, upfront payment you make when you buy a new home. Typically, down payments are 3-20% of the homes purchase price, but first-time homebuyers, on average, put down 7%. If youre eligible for a Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan, your down payment could be as low as 3.5%. A Key Example There are two different ways to calculate your down payment: multiplying your desired purchase price by the percentage you want to put down or dividing the amount youve saved for a down payment by the purchase price. 1. Multiplying: Say youve liked homes in the $200,000 range and want to estimate how much youd need for the down payment. For an FHA loan with a 3.5% down payment requirement, youd need $7,000 (200,000 x 0.035 = 7,000). To pay 7% down, youd need $14,000. 2. Dividing: Now, imagine you already have $10,000 saved for a down payment and want to know what percentage down that would be. For a $200,000 home, youd be able to offer 5% down (10,000 200,000 = 0.05). If the home is $250,000, youd have a 4% down payment.",

As a matter of fact, many times the FHA mortgage payment is less expensive than a conventional loan. First time buyers with an FHA loan actually make out better because their FICO score is not used to base interest rates on. Even with the FHA insurance premium rolled into the loan, and monthly mortgage insurance, the monthly payment could be less. Myth #7 - The FHA mortgage insurance is unaffordable. Not really. Any loan in which 80% or more of the property value is financed must carry mortgage insurance, whether it is a conventional loan or an FHA loan.

FHA requires 1 .75% upfront insurance. This is financed into your loan. Additionally, 1 .35% per year is also added and divided up over your payments.

With these property-level estimates of price and asking rent, our preferred method for evaluating the breakeven simulation at scale (for many different regions and scenarios) is to set rent in the first year such that R0 = ZHVIt=0 x MEDIANi=1,..,K(ZRi,t=0 / ZFSi,t=0), In which K is the total number of housing units (single-family, townhouses, condos and co-ops; excludes mobile homes) in the region. WHY NOT JUST USE THE ZESTIMATE AND RENTAL ZESTIMATE AT THE PROPERTY LEVEL? The computer processing load to estimate the full simulation is too great to reliably run the buy vs. rent break even simulation at the property level for public production.

    "answer": "et and enable folks who may be unable to qualify for conventional loans to still become homeowners. Who qualifies? That depends on which government loan youre looking at.YOUR STRESS-FREE GUIDE TO SHOPPING FOR HOME LOANS If you put less than 20% down for a conventional loan, youll be required to pay private mortgage insurance (PMI), an extra monthly fee designed to mitigate the risk to the lender that a borrower could default on a loan. (PMI ranges from about 0.3% to 1.15% of your home loan.) The upshot: The lender has to cancel PMI when you reach 22% equity in your home, and you can request to have it canceled once you hit 20% equity. Most conventional loans also have a maximum 43% dept-to- income (DTI) ratio, which compares how much money you owe (on student loans, credit cards, car loans, and other debts) to your income - expressed as a percentage.

They have multiple paths they can take in gaining this lifestyle. We want to answer whether it is better to rent or to buy the same home to achieve that lifestyle. Buying a home = a consumption decision for ongoing shelter and utility in the space plus an investment decision on an appreciating asset (with maintenance). So the alternative, and opportunity cost, is renting to consume shelter and utility from the space, and investing in some alternative asset unrelated to real estate that has a similar risk and return. What well do: Simulate the purely financial aspect of the decision so that the decision maker can decide if it is financially advantageous to commit to homeownership with a fixed-rate loan. Functionally, well estimate the time horizon the buyer needs to maintain ownership to breakeven or if the difference in simulated costs on a short(er) horizon is at least at a price low enough to pay for the utility of full control of the property over that time.

    "answer": "aid by the end of the loan term; rather, a t the end of the five-year term, the remaining loan bala nce had to be paid in a lump sum or the mortgage had to be renegotiated. During the Great Depression, lenders were unable or unwilling to refinance many of the loans that became due. Thus, many borrowers lost their homes through foreclosure, and lenders lo st money because property values were falling. Lenders became wary of the mortgage market. FHA institutionalized a new idea: 20 -year mortgages on which the loan would be completely repaid at the end of the loan term. If borrowers defaulted, FHA insured tha t the lender would be fully repaid. By standardizing mortgage instruments and setting certain standards for mortgages, the creation of FHA was meant to instill confidence in the mortgage market and, in turn, help to stimulate investment in housing and the overall economy . Eventually, lenders began to make long-term mortgages without FHA insurance if borrowers made significant down payments. Over time, 15 - and 30-year mortgages have become standard mortgage products. When the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) was created in 1965, FHA became part of HUD. Today, FHA is intended to facilitate access to affordable mortgages for some households who otherwise might not be we ll-served by the private market .",

A: A fixed-rate mortgage (FRM) means your interest rate and monthly payments will stay the same for the life of the loan. Approximately 90% of homebuyers choose FRMs; 30-year is the most common, but 15-year is a good choice for some. An FRM is easy to budget for and helps ensure that your housing costs dont rise with market changes, but if you get the mortgage when interest rates are high, youll be stuck with that rate unless you decide to refinance. Q: What Is an Adjustable-Rate Mortgage? A: An adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) means your interest rate - and therefore your monthly payments - may change over time. ARMs are split into an initial period, when your rate will remain constant for a set number of years - sometimes called a 10/1, which means your interest rate remains fixed for 10 years and is adjustable for the remaining 20 years of the loan term - and an adjustment period, when your rate can change with market conditions. ARMs offer lower monthly payments than FRMs during the initial period, but they can increase dramatically once the adjustment period begins.

So, if youre going up against multiple offers, making an offer with fewer contingencies can potentially give you an edge over the competition. In other words: A chill offer is an attractive offer. But keep in mind you have to be comfortable with the risks that come with this strategy. If you dont have a financing contingency, for example, and you cant get a mortgage, youd likely lose your earnest money deposit since youre on the hook. (An outcome thats decidedly un-chill for you.)MAKE AN OFFER LIKE A BOSS The sales contract states key information about the property, such as the address, tax ID, and the types of utilities: public water or private well, gas or electric heating, and so on. It also includes a section that specifies what personal property and fixtures the seller agrees to leave behind, like appliances, lighting fixtures, and window shades. The seller provides prospective buyers with a list of these items before they submit an offer. This can be another area of negotiation. Carefully reviewing the property description also helps you know, for example, if the seller plans to take that unattached kitchen island with them when they move.

But depending on how hot the market is where you live, you may want to put down more earnest money to compete with other offers. In most cases, the title company is responsible for holding the earnest money in an escrow account. In the event the deal falls through, the title company will disperse the funds appropriately based on the terms of the sales contract. Title companies also check for defects or liens on a sellers title to make sure it can be transferred cleanly to you.#5 Show the Seller Youre Serious: Make a Deposit Most real estate offers include contingencies - provisions that must be met before the transaction can go through, or the buyer is entitled to walk away from the deal with their EMD. For example, if an offer says, This contract is contingent upon a home inspection, the buyer has a set number of days after the offer is accepted to do an inspection of the property with a licensed or certified home inspector. If something is wrong with the house, the buyer can request the seller to make repairs. But most repairs are negotiable; the seller may agree to some, but say no to others. Or the seller can offer a price reduction, or a credit at closing, based on the cost of the repairs.",

    "answer": "rfect if you can lock in a low rate and will protect you against the risk of rising interest rates. This kind of stability also helps make budgeting easier. Be mindful, however, not to lock yourself into a high rate. With a fixed-rate mortgage you must also take term length into account. Short-term mortgages such as a 15-year will have lower rates than a 30-year term. While you will pay less interest over the life of a shorter term loan, your monthly payments will be higher. 14 Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARM) have interest rates that will move up or down in correlation with economic trends. These rates are commonly based on the U.S. Treasury index for a one-year Treasury bill. Lenders usually add 2-4% to the index rate to get their ARM rate. The advantage of an ARM is that the initial rate is lower than the fixed-rate mortgage by a quarter point to two points or more. This rate will periodically adjust within set cap limits that are specified by the terms of the loan. Keep in mind that your credit status will ultimately help determine the loan you qualify for. The better your credit, the better your rates and terms will be. So consider paying off your credit cards and be sure to make all other bill payments in full and on time. 5. Ready. Set. Apply!

For conventional loans (as opposed to government loans), making a 20% down payment enables borrowers to avoid having to pay private mortgage insurance (PMI), a monthly premium that protects the lender in case the borrower defaults on the loan. But 20% isnt always feasible - or even necessary. In fact, the median down payment was 10% in 2017 , according to the National Association of REALTORS. Y our lender will help you determine what the best down payment amount is for your finances. Depending on the type of loan you get, you may even be able to put down as little as 0% on your mortgage.

    "question": "How does the document describe longer?",
    "answer": "R 3 Myth #4 - Y ou will have to wait longer for an FHA loan approval. This is a big, resounding no. Thanks to the Internet, computers allow for automated underwriting and paperless processing, so it does not take the FHA any longer to approve a loan that it does a conventional loan. If you are under the care of an FHA educated loan officer then the process could even go faster as the paperwork and any documentation needed is submitted all at once instead of piecemeal. Myth #5 - There is a ton of extra paperwork associated with an FHA loan. This is another big resounding no. Conventional loans and FHA loans have pretty much the same amount of paperwork that need to be filled out and submitted. The FHA loans do require a few different, extra documents that need to be filled out, but they are designed to protect you while you are going through the process of securing the loan. Plus, with the ability to print off most of the documents with your demographic information - address, phone number, income, etc. - already filled in, the most you will need to do is initial a few more pages.Myth #6 - Im going to pay more for an FHA loan than a conventional one. Im not sure how this particular myth got started, but the interest rate that is used on a conventional loan is the same that is used on an FHA loan. Both are based on the current market factors and interest rates that are in force at the time of price locking.",

The property tax deductions and mortgage interest deduction (MID) used to be bigger deals, but then standard deduction doubled in 2016, balancing the playing field between buyers and renters from those sources in all but the most expensive homes. But then, those homeowners dont get to run away to enjoy the tax breaks too much, since both the MID and state and local tax deductions (SALT) have been capped. The real benefit is the capital gains exclusion: $250K for singles and $500K for married-filing jointly. Thats no taxes on profits up to $500K. In stock markets youll likely pay 15%, 25% if very high income, on the profit you make. RENTING AND INVESTING IN STOCKS Renters who invest in stocks instead accept the uncertainty and risk of stock market volatility and potential rent hikes. This is what economists call the opportunity cost of buying. Its what you lost when you didnt take the road not taken. When you used your down payment to buy the house, you lost the opportunity to earn a rate of return on an alternative asset. A renter can invest their down payment, and any savings each month, if any, into a diversified investment portfolio with much lower transaction costs or broker fees than in real estate.

    "answer": "settlement, home buyers have to pay closing costs for taxes, lenders fees, and title company fees. Closing costs vary by location, but you can expect to shell out between 3% and 4% of the homes sales price. The seller pays an additional 1% to 3%. (SmartAsset.com and Nerdwallet.com have simple calculators you can use to get a rough idea of what your closing costs might be.) When making an initial offer, you have the option to ask the seller for concessions - a settlement paid in cash to help you offset your share of the closing costs. (This move is less feasible if youre going up against multiple offers.) Concessions effectively lower the sellers net proceeds from the sale. Making a counteroffer that removes the concessions you would have otherwise received at settlement puts cash back in the sellers pocket - and can improve your bid. #6 Ask for Fewer Concessions Reduce the number of contingencies youre asking for. Its your way of saying, Hey, look, I have fewer ways to back out, which gives the seller more reassurance that the deal will close. But be selective: Some contingencies are too important to give up. A home-inspection contingency - the right to have a home inspection and request repairs - gives you an out if you spot major problems with the home (and protects you from buying a total money pit).

    "answer": "rd work you and your tax professional put into minimizing your tax liability could really hurt you. Here is why: lenders look at your net taxable income for the tax year, not your gross income. This means that if your half a million dollar a year business deducted every possible penny you could and only showed you with a net taxable income of twenty five thousand dollars for the tax year, then that is all lenders can use to qualify you for a mortgage. 2. Credit - Does your credit reports reflect steady payment history and the ability to manage your finances, or does it show a person who rarely pays their bills on time? Lenders want to see at least a 620 middle credit score. 3. Loan-To-Value (LTV) - Are you looking to essentially finance every single penny that you can, or are you giving a sizable down payment? Lenders are limiting their financing to about 96.5% for first-time homebuyers in the current economy. If the purchase price is $250,000 and you have $8,750 for a down payment and closing costs, then you are borrowing $241,250. That means that you have a 96.5% LTV. EXAMPLE: $250,000 purchase price - $8,750 down payment = $241,250 $241,250/ $250,000 = .965 or 96.5% LTV 4.

    "answer": "FHA LOANS: CREDIT GUIDELINES HUD requires a borrower to demonstrate a good to excellent repayment history of all debs. This history serves as the most useful guide in determining a borrowers willingness to repay credit obligations and serves as a model in predicating his/hers future actions. A borrower who has made payments on previous or current credit obligations (such as credit cards, student loans, etc.) in a timely manner represent a reduced risk to HUD. Conversely, if the credit history, despite sufficient income to supports these debts, continuously reflects slow or often late payments, judgments and delinquent credit accounts, strong offsetting factors will be necessary to approve the loan. When analyzing a borrowers credit report, it is important to focus upon the general pattern of credit behavior rather than isolated occurrences of late payments. Often times, people will experience a period of financial difficulty in the past and does not necessarily translate into unacceptable risk. Reasonable explanations of the credit derogatory and evidence for offsetting factors (such as a new job or promotion with greater stability and pay, for example) will be necessary. All derogatory credit information must be explained, in writing, by the borrower.

    "question": "How does the document describe interest?",
    "answer": "888 | moreirateam.com CHAPTER 2 How much do I need for a down payment if I qualify for an FHA loan? Most loans require a down payment that equals approximately 5% - 10% of the purchasing price, but most applicants qualify for a 3.5% down payment on an FHA loan. FHA will allow applicants to use money that is gifted to them from a family member or a friend for their down payment. What will the annual percentage rate on my loan be? Is it the same as the interest rate on my loan? The annual percentage rate (APR) is not the same as the interest rate on your loan. The interest rate on your loan is the percentage you pay per so many dollars you borrow. This is the fee the lender charges you to borrow the money. The APR is a value that reflects the actual cost of borrowing the money and it includes all of the fees that go with purchasing your home. Because each loan is different, your APR will be different than someone elses. There is no set number because the government uses a special formula to calculate this number. This number is determined by taking the amount of money you are borrowing and adding the closing costs on the loan and any other fees accumulated to the borrowing amount. All of the interest that you will be paying over the length of the loan - usually 30 years for an FHA loan - is added into the figure and it is then broken down into the rate, reflected as percentage. Say you borrow $250,000 to pay for the home.",
