Also, military servic e of the borrower may delay foreclosure proceedings (24 C.F.R. 203.346). 44 Congress authorized FHA to undertake certain types of loss mitigation actions in 1996.

What does the document say about inspection?,"settlement, home buyers have to pay closing costs for taxes, lenders fees, and title company fees. Closing costs vary by location, but you can expect to shell out between 3% and 4% of the homes sales price. The seller pays an additional 1% to 3%. (SmartAsset.com and Nerdwallet.com have simple calculators you can use to get a rough idea of what your closing costs might be.) When making an initial offer, you have the option to ask the seller for concessions - a settlement paid in cash to help you offset your share of the closing costs. (This move is less feasible if youre going up against multiple offers.) Concessions effectively lower the sellers net proceeds from the sale. Making a counteroffer that removes the concessions you would have otherwise received at settlement puts cash back in the sellers pocket - and can improve your bid. #6 Ask for Fewer Concessions Reduce the number of contingencies youre asking for. Its your way of saying, Hey, look, I have fewer ways to back out, which gives the seller more reassurance that the deal will close. But be selective: Some contingencies are too important to give up. A home-inspection contingency - the right to have a home inspection and request repairs - gives you an out if you spot major problems with the home (and protects you from buying a total money pit).

What are the key points mentioned about creation?,"aid by the end of the loan term; rather, a t the end of the five-year term, the remaining loan bala nce had to be paid in a lump sum or the mortgage had to be renegotiated. During the Great Depression, lenders were unable or unwilling to refinance many of the loans that became due. Thus, many borrowers lost their homes through foreclosure, and lenders lo st money because property values were falling. Lenders became wary of the mortgage market. FHA institutionalized a new idea: 20 -year mortgages on which the loan would be completely repaid at the end of the loan term. If borrowers defaulted, FHA insured tha t the lender would be fully repaid. By standardizing mortgage instruments and setting certain standards for mortgages, the creation of FHA was meant to instill confidence in the mortgage market and, in turn, help to stimulate investment in housing and the overall economy . Eventually, lenders began to make long-term mortgages without FHA insurance if borrowers made significant down payments. Over time, 15 - and 30-year mortgages have become standard mortgage products. When the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) was created in 1965, FHA became part of HUD. Today, FHA is intended to facilitate access to affordable mortgages for some households who otherwise might not be we ll-served by the private market ."

How does the document describe interest?,"888 | moreirateam.com CHAPTER 2 How much do I need for a down payment if I qualify for an FHA loan? Most loans require a down payment that equals approximately 5% - 10% of the purchasing price, but most applicants qualify for a 3.5% down payment on an FHA loan. FHA will allow applicants to use money that is gifted to them from a family member or a friend for their down payment. What will the annual percentage rate on my loan be? Is it the same as the interest rate on my loan? The annual percentage rate (APR) is not the same as the interest rate on your loan. The interest rate on your loan is the percentage you pay per so many dollars you borrow. This is the fee the lender charges you to borrow the money. The APR is a value that reflects the actual cost of borrowing the money and it includes all of the fees that go with purchasing your home. Because each loan is different, your APR will be different than someone elses. There is no set number because the government uses a special formula to calculate this number. This number is determined by taking the amount of money you are borrowing and adding the closing costs on the loan and any other fees accumulated to the borrowing amount. All of the interest that you will be paying over the length of the loan - usually 30 years for an FHA loan - is added into the figure and it is then broken down into the rate, reflected as percentage. Say you borrow $250,000 to pay for the home."

Can you explain foreclosure based on the text?,"n defaulted mortgages where the borrowers were no longer paying annual mortgage insurance premiums. This could occur because FHA insures the remaining mortgage amount for the life of the loan, and because premiums were cancelled when the loan amortiz ed to a percentage of the initial property value rather than the current value of the home . Cancelling premiums based on the initial property value meant that premiums could be cancelled even if house price declines had left borrowers with little current equity i n their homes.42 Options for FHA -Insured Loans in Default An FHA -insured mortgage is considered delinquent any time a payment is due and not paid. Once the borrower is 30 days late in making a payment, the mortgage is considered to be in default. In general, mortgage servicers may initiate foreclosure on an FHA -insured loan when three monthly installments are due and unpaid, and they must initiate foreclosure when six monthly installments are due and unpaid, except when prohibited by law.43 Prior to i nitiating foreclosure, mortgage servicers are to attempt to make contact with borrowers and evaluate whether they qualify for certain foreclosure avoidance options, known as loss mitigation.44 The options are to be considered in a specific order , and specif ic eligibility criteria apply to each option .

What does the document say about Rental?,"rd work you and your tax professional put into minimizing your tax liability could really hurt you. Here is why: lenders look at your net taxable income for the tax year, not your gross income. This means that if your half a million dollar a year business deducted every possible penny you could and only showed you with a net taxable income of twenty five thousand dollars for the tax year, then that is all lenders can use to qualify you for a mortgage. 2. Credit - Does your credit reports reflect steady payment history and the ability to manage your finances, or does it show a person who rarely pays their bills on time? Lenders want to see at least a 620 middle credit score. 3. Loan-To-Value (LTV) - Are you looking to essentially finance every single penny that you can, or are you giving a sizable down payment? Lenders are limiting their financing to about 96.5% for first-time homebuyers in the current economy. If the purchase price is $250,000 and you have $8,750 for a down payment and closing costs, then you are borrowing $241,250. That means that you have a 96.5% LTV. EXAMPLE: $250,000 purchase price - $8,750 down payment = $241,250 $241,250/ $250,000 = .965 or 96.5% LTV 4.

Maybe the home was under contract but the buyers financing fell through, or the seller overshot the listing price and had to make a price reduction? Knowing the backstory can only help you. 6.

Have there been any renovations or recent repairs made to the home? Some upgrades, like new kitchen appliances, are easy to spot, but some are harder to identify. Specifically ask about the roof, appliances, and HVAC system because they can be expensive to repair or replace. BTW, repairs like a leaky faucet, arent things that need to be disclosed. 8.

With a 1031 exchange, property owners can sell their real estate and then reinvest the proceeds in ownership of a like-kind property or up to three like-kind properties, thus deferring the capital gains taxes. The owner must identify the property(ies) within 45 days and close within 180 days. 1031 exchanges are legal transactions and require a 1031 intermediary. The like-kind exchange under Section 1031 is tax-deferred, not tax-free. When the replacement property is ultimately sold (not as part of another exchange), the original deferred gain, plus any additional gain realized since the purchase of the replacement property, is subject to tax.

Capital Expenses or Cap Ex Improvements (as opposed to repairs) to a fixed asset that will increase the value or useful life of that asset.

What are the key points mentioned about thousands?,"the lenders gross fees for writing your loan. An online lender is going to offer less hand-holding. Mortgage Brokers What they are: Mortgage brokers are essentially personal home loan shoppers - they act as liaisons between home buyers and mortgage lenders to help people find the lowest rates and the best mortgage terms. Theyre able to get home buyers the best mortgage rates because they leverage their existing relationships with lenders - something individual home buyers cant do. By doing the heavy lifting for the borrower, the idea is that they make loan shopping more convenient - and perhaps a bit faster. Who youll work with: A mortgage broker can be an individual agent or a group of agents, who act as independent contractors. In exchange for their services, mortgage brokers typically charge a 1% to 2% fee of the loan amount, which is either paid by the borrower or the lender at closing. Now that youre armed with the basics, youll want to give yourself time to weigh the options about which lender, exactly, to work with. Over the life of the loan, seemingly subtle differences could add up to tens of thousands of dollars. That money belongs to future you and all your dream vacations, renovations, and remodeling #goals.It Pays to Shop Around Before You Commit So before you choose your specific lender ...

What are the key points mentioned about renovation?,"ermine the present value of future cash flows. A discount rate reflects the risk of the investment. Higher discount rates equate to higher levels of risk and higher expected return. Lower discount rates equate to lower levels of risk and lower expected return. Entry Cap Rate The entry cap rate represents the going-in or entry rate when acquiring a building. It is typically the projected first years net operating income divided by the acquisition price. Exit Cap Rate The exit cap rate, sometimes called terminal or reversion cap rate, is the expected capitalization rate at sale. For example, in a five-year discounted cash flow projection, the expected sale price would be the sixth years project cash flow divided by the exit cap rate. Best practice for cash flow projections would have the exit cap rate at a higher yield (lower price) than the entry cap rate. Internal Rate of Return (IRR) The annualized yield, or rate of return, on capital investment produced from an income-producing investment. Formally, IRR is the discount rate such that the discounted sum of the future cash flows (net present value) equals the initial capital investment. IRR may be measured unlevered (without debt), levered (with debt), before tax or after tax. Loan-to-Value Ratio (LTV) The ratio between a mortgage loan and the value of the property pledged as security, usually expressed as a percentage. In a construction or renovation (bridge) loan, the loan commitment is the typical numerator."
What are the key points mentioned about expensive?,"Tax benefits The U.S. has long encouraged and supported home buying, so there are big tax benefits. The property tax deductions and mortgage interest deduction (MID) used to be bigger deals, but then standard deduction doubled in 2016, balancing the playing field between buyers and renters from those sources in all but the most expensive homes. But then, those homeowners dont get to run away to enjoy the tax breaks too much, since both the MID and state and local tax deductions (SALT) have been capped. The real benefit is the capital gains exclusion: $250K for singles and $500K for married-filing jointly. Thats no taxes on profits up to $500K. In stock markets youll likely pay 15%, 25% if very high income, on the profit you make. RENTING AND INVESTING IN STOCKS Renters who invest in stocks instead accept the uncertainty and risk of stock market volatility and potential rent hikes. This is what economists call the opportunity cost of buying. Its what you lost when you didnt take the road not taken. When you used your down payment to buy the house, you lost the opportunity to earn a rate of return on an alternative asset. A renter can invest their down payment, and any savings each month, if any, into a diversified investment portfolio with much lower transaction costs or broker fees than in real estate. The stock market is traditionally more volatile, allows fewer tax breaks, and is without the government- 10 Buy vs."

Can you explain calculate based on the text?,"rs insurance* (liability, flood, fire) + Electric/gas/water/trash pickup + Maintenance/repairs/upkeep (lawn care, pest control, etc.) + Other (security system, HOA, etc.) = Total Monthly Estimated Housing Expenses $ GETTING YOUR FINANCIAL HOUSE IN ORDER THE UL TIMATE GUIDE FOR FIRST-TIME HOMEBUYERS EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE YOU BUY YOUR FIRST HOMEHOW MUCH DO YOU NEED FOR A DOWN PAYMENT? A down payment is the out-of-pocket, upfront payment you make when you buy a new home. Typically, down payments are 3-20% of the homes purchase price, but first-time homebuyers, on average, put down 7%. If youre eligible for a Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan, your down payment could be as low as 3.5%. A Key Example There are two different ways to calculate your down payment: multiplying your desired purchase price by the percentage you want to put down or dividing the amount youve saved for a down payment by the purchase price. 1. Multiplying: Say youve liked homes in the $200,000 range and want to estimate how much youd need for the down payment. For an FHA loan with a 3.5% down payment requirement, youd need $7,000 (200,000 x 0.035 = 7,000). To pay 7% down, youd need $14,000. 2. Dividing: Now, imagine you already have $10,000 saved for a down payment and want to know what percentage down that would be. For a $200,000 home, youd be able to offer 5% down (10,000 200,000 = 0.05). If the home is $250,000, youd have a 4% down payment."

States that allow it have laws that dictate when dual agency must be disclosed, if the agent must explain what dual agency means, and whether the buyer and seller must provide written or verbal agreement. If your agent discloses dual agency, you have the right to decide if you want to proceed with the transaction with your agent or another agent - or walk away from the purchase entirely.

How does the document describe longer?,"R 3 Myth #4 - Y ou will have to wait longer for an FHA loan approval. This is a big, resounding no. Thanks to the Internet, computers allow for automated underwriting and paperless processing, so it does not take the FHA any longer to approve a loan that it does a conventional loan. If you are under the care of an FHA educated loan officer then the process could even go faster as the paperwork and any documentation needed is submitted all at once instead of piecemeal. Myth #5 - There is a ton of extra paperwork associated with an FHA loan. This is another big resounding no. Conventional loans and FHA loans have pretty much the same amount of paperwork that need to be filled out and submitted. The FHA loans do require a few different, extra documents that need to be filled out, but they are designed to protect you while you are going through the process of securing the loan. Plus, with the ability to print off most of the documents with your demographic information - address, phone number, income, etc. - already filled in, the most you will need to do is initial a few more pages.Myth #6 - Im going to pay more for an FHA loan than a conventional one. Im not sure how this particular myth got started, but the interest rate that is used on a conventional loan is the same that is used on an FHA loan. Both are based on the current market factors and interest rates that are in force at the time of price locking."

Can you explain REALTOR based on the text?,"egotiate With The Seller Now that youve found the home youd like to buy, its time to make an offer. Your local real estate association, working with legal counsel, has developed the contracts that are used for transactions in your area. These contracts enable you to specify a sale price and also include many clauses for specifying various terms of purchase, such as the closing and possession dates, your deposit amount, and other conditions. You should carefully review these clauses with your REALTOR to ensure that they express your desired offer. In addition to drawing up the contract, your REALTOR will be happy to address all your questions about the offer process.* Once youve written the offer, your REALTOR will present it to the seller and/or the sellers representative. At that point, the process - given that a homes eventual sale price is subject to supply and demand - will depend on the kind of market youre in.

How does the document describe credit?,"FHA LOANS: CREDIT GUIDELINES HUD requires a borrower to demonstrate a good to excellent repayment history of all debs. This history serves as the most useful guide in determining a borrowers willingness to repay credit obligations and serves as a model in predicating his/hers future actions. A borrower who has made payments on previous or current credit obligations (such as credit cards, student loans, etc.) in a timely manner represent a reduced risk to HUD. Conversely, if the credit history, despite sufficient income to supports these debts, continuously reflects slow or often late payments, judgments and delinquent credit accounts, strong offsetting factors will be necessary to approve the loan. When analyzing a borrowers credit report, it is important to focus upon the general pattern of credit behavior rather than isolated occurrences of late payments. Often times, people will experience a period of financial difficulty in the past and does not necessarily translate into unacceptable risk. Reasonable explanations of the credit derogatory and evidence for offsetting factors (such as a new job or promotion with greater stability and pay, for example) will be necessary. All derogatory credit information must be explained, in writing, by the borrower. The following is a brief synopsis of the credit underwriting guidelines for FHA home loans: Lack of Credit History: If a borrower does not have a minimum of 2 trade lines on their credit report, alternative forms of credit may"

These property sites also collect reviews and ratings from an agents past clients, which gives you insight into an agents reputation. Keep in mind, though, that the sites vary in their policies about whether agents can edit or remove reviews. (Like with Y elp, use your own discretion.) The sites also show an agents sales history, so you can see how many homes a person has sold. In general, its best to choose an agent who has a large number of sales under his or her belt (a sign theyre committed to real estate work). Perhaps even more important: an agent who has sold homes at the price point and in the neighborhood where youre looking to buy - a sign they understand the local market. Whatever you do, dont rely on online listings alone. Always interview prospective agents - at least three - in person. A meet-and-greet will give you the perspective you need on the agents personality and style. Is this someone youll like working with? Who has a sense of humor? Who has your back? Who communicates in the ways you want to be communicated with? Best to find out in person. Once youve gathered all the information, listen to your gut: It wont steer you wrong about whos the best agent for you. But, that said, there are a few qualities youll want to look for in any agent (your gut would agree): Local expertise."

Any loan in which 80% or more of the property value is financed must carry mortgage insurance, whether it is a conventional loan or an FHA loan.

What does the document say about process?,"why its a good idea to get a professional inspection of your home - even before you make the offer. HUD strongly urges every home buyer to get a professional inspection, whether youre buying a HUD Home or not. HUD Homes are sold in as-is condition. That means you agree, if you buy the home, to accept it in its present condition. HUD does not pay for the correction of defects in existing homes that it sells or on homes purchased with FHA-insured mortgages. The owner of the home will be responsible for needed repairs. Therefore, be sure of the condition of the home before you submit your offer. THE FINISH LINE. The day you finally close on your new home will probably be one of the most exciting in your life. Finally, the long, tedious process of finding a home and getting a loan is over, and by the time the day is done, youll be the proud and happy owner of your new home. Before that day ends, you will be asked to sign a seemingly endless number of forms, but the closing agent will go over each one with you. Its all necessary, but you can make it a little easier by asking the real estate agent about it before the big day comes. Also, when you apply for your loan, your lender is required to give you a booklet explaining closing costs, an estimate of how much cash youll have to supply at the closing, and a list of all the documents youll need."

They have multiple paths they can take in gaining this lifestyle. We want to answer whether it is better to rent or to buy the same home to achieve that lifestyle. Buying a home = a consumption decision for ongoing shelter and utility in the space plus an investment decision on an appreciating asset (with maintenance). So the alternative, and opportunity cost, is renting to consume shelter and utility from the space, and investing in some alternative asset unrelated to real estate that has a similar risk and return. What well do: Simulate the purely financial aspect of the decision so that the decision maker can decide if it is financially advantageous to commit to homeownership with a fixed-rate loan. Functionally, well estimate the time horizon the buyer needs to maintain ownership to breakeven or if the difference in simulated costs on a short(er) horizon is at least at a price low enough to pay for the utility of full control of the property over that time. Optimality then implies that a renter becomes a buyer if and only if: Where St=TB ,St=TR denote the net present value for being a buyer and a renter respectively at time T, the intended years after purchase the buyer hopes to move again."

Younger buyers in particular move more often. Full control over your space and the opportunity for customization, may still be worth the economic cost of ownership even if leaving earlier than intended. When mortgage rates were near 3%, a new homeowner could still earn a windfall after only 5 years. Today, short hold periods or home flipping is much harder, but for those with trade-skills, sweat equity can further reduce the economic loss of a short tenure owning. The buyer secures a 30-year fixed rate mortgage with a 20% down payment. The owner spends 1% of the home's value in maintenance and 1.5% in property taxes plus insurance annually. Mortgage amoritization, tax breaks, and home price growth are incorporated.

If the loan term is 25 months or less, the Lender will receive one billing statement that reflects the entire insurance charge.

The final annual installment may be adjusted to reconcile with the total insurance charge due. A premium is not required and HUD will not bill for a period of 14 Days or less after acknowledgement of the loan report in FHAC. A charge for a full month is assessed for a period of more than 14 Days.
